## Global Rules

- Whenever you `cd` somewhere to do something, always navigate back to previous location so next steps are not lost!
- Stay concise and stick to any initial plan
- Whenever you have to write a file, do following:
  1. `echo "" > {file}`
  2. Read {file}
  3. Write content to {file}
